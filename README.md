# Mathematical Primer for Quantum Mechanics

This primer serves as a companion to [Principles of Quantum Mechanics by R. Shankar](https://www.amazon.ca/Principles-Quantum-Mechanics-Second-Shankar/dp/0306447908). I cover the mathematical introduction in the textbook with a more interactive and (hopefully) comprehensive take. Much of the mathematics here is an expansion of differential equations, vector calculus, and linear algebra that many Physics and Engineering majors learn in their undergraduate study. This is a more general formalism on those subjects in the context of quantum mechanics. For any overlaps, I attempt to elucidate topics that I found were poorly presented during my study*. Therefore, this primer is merely one more poor take on these topics.

Inspired by R. Labbe's [book](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python) on Kalman and Bayesian Filters, I use Jupyter Notebook to make the topics as interactive as as possible. For example, the Gram-Schmidt procedure for recovering orthonormal bases from a linearly independent set is outlined in the textbook but can be difficult to motivate and visualize. 

The current goal is to present the concepts in an interesting way before eventually providing a comprehensive standalone. The mathematical proofs in this primer are my attempts to expand on those already provided in the book, provide proofs where I found they were missing, or simply left as an exercise for the reader. 

<sub><sup>* This is not a potshot at my Professors, I find this to be the case with how these topics are presented in most places.</sup></sub>
