Similarly, we can represent a linear operator $\\Omega$ as the inner product between the previous basis and the new basis of a vector space. $\\Omega$ acts as an instruction set on how to transform a basis of a vector space where each element of $\\Omega$ can be represented as $\\braket{j}{i'}= \\Omega_{ji} = \\bra{j}{\\Omega}\\ket{i}$. Therefore, $\\Omega$ acts as a recipe for telling us how we should transform a basis vector $\\ket{i}$ to $\\ket{i'}$ by providing the components of $\\ket{i'}$ in the origional (pre-transformation) basis.\n",
